# Understanding Computer Architechture
# By: Damon Jennings
## While this was my first information technology course, I understood very little about the pieces that made up the computer itself.  This tutorial will hopefully give readers a cheatsheet to better understand what each component is, where it is located and the role which it plays within the computer structure.  The target audience is for beginners...let's get started!

> Motherboard

Holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system.

> Central Processing Unit

![](CPU.jpg)

The electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output operations specified by the instructions.

> Chipset

> Universial Serial Bus (USB)

![](usb.jpg)

Universial serial bus is an industry standard that was developed to define cables, connectors and protocols for connection, communication, and power supply between person computers and their peripheral devices.

> Data Storage

![](data-storage.jpg)

Data Storage is the recording of information in a storage medim.  Recording is accomplished by virtually any form of energy and is one of the core functions of a general purpose computer.
