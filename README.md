# Understanding Computer Architechture
# By: Damon Jennings
## While this was my first information technology course, I understood very little about the pieces that made up the computer itself.  This tutorial will hopefully give readers a cheatsheet to better understand what each component is, where it is located and the role which it plays within the computer structure.  The target audience is for beginners...let's get started!

> Motherboard

Holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system.

The electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output operations specified by the instructions.

> Chipset

Composed of two chips, Northbridge and Southbridge, found in the core logic chipset architecture on a PC motherboard.  These two chips manage communications between the CPU and other parts of the motherboard.
